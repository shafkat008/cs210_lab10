# Lab Exercise

There are three files used in this program:
- BSTree.h — templated binary search tree implementation. getCount()and getHeight()functions are in this file.
- config.h — controls to enable or disable getCount() and getHeight() functionality.
- test.cpp — the main program.

Implement getCountHelper and getHeightHelper. You will find prototypes and partial function definitions for both in BSTree.h

See the lab page for more information
